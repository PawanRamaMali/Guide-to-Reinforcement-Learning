Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. In reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence faces a game-like situation. The computer employs trial and error to come up with a solution to the problem. To get the machine to do what the programmer wants, the artificial intelligence gets either rewards or penalties for the actions it performs. Its goal is to maximize the total reward.


### The five principles of Reinforcement Learning

Here are the five fundamental principles:

#1: The input and output system
#2: The reward
#3: The AI environment
#4: The Markov decision process
#5: Training and inference
