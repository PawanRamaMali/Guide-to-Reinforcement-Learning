Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment. The computer employs trial and error to come up with a solution to the problem. To get the machine to do what the programmer wants, the artificial intelligence gets either rewards or penalties for the actions it performs. Its goal is to maximize the total reward.


### The five principles of Reinforcement Learning

Here are the five fundamental principles:

* 1: The input and output system
* 2: The reward
* 3: The AI environment
* 4: The Markov decision process
* 5: Training and inference

### What is Reinforcement Learning?

Machine Learning does not include the process of taking actions and interacting with an environment like we humans do. 
As intelligent human beings, what we constantly keep doing is the following:
  * We observe some input, whether it's what we see with our eyes, what we hear with our ears, or what we remember in our memory.
  * These inputs are then processed in our brain.
  * Eventually, we make decisions and take actions.
This process of interacting with an environment is what we are trying to reproduce in terms of Artificial Intelligence. And to that extent, the branch of AI that works on this is Reinforcement Learning. 

### Principle #1 â€“ The input and output system

Reinforcement Learning models, will take something as input, and will return another thing as output.

* The input is called the state, or input state. 
* The output is the action performed by the AI. 
* And in the middle, we have a function (policy) that takes a state as input and returns an action as output.
